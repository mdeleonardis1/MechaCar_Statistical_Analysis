* The intecept, vehicle_lenght, and ground_clearance are all statistically significant with p-values less than .001
* The slope is dependent on the values of the varaibles and their slope terms
* The model has a R-squared of over .75 which indicates much of the variance is explained by the model. However, the slope terms of the variables are not of a    significant magnitude and the intercept is the has the largest magintude and strong statistical significance. It is likely the modle is suffering from ommited variable biasis.

## MEchaCar to the Competition - Deliverable 4

MechaCar to the Competition study would compare MPP (conitnous variable) of the differnce vehicle brands to similar models (categroical variable).
H0: the means of all models are equal
Ha: At least one of the means is diffent from all other groups

The study would use the ANPVe test. Data required would be of HWy MPG of several similar model cars to the MEchaCAr model of interest.
